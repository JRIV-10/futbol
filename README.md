# Futbol
## Deliverables
1. 1-2 summary or bullet points outlining your plan for check-ins throughout the duration of the project.
    * Daily check-ins at 4pm MST 
    * Using github project to track the project of each pair

2. 2-4 sentence summary of your plan for project organization and workflow. This can include bullet points. If you plan to use a project management tool, please include a link to your project board.

    Our plan is to pair into groups of 2 to work on specific classes and methods. We created a github project to organize how to code desgin, what needs to be done, what is in progress, what is ready to be refactored, and what is completed. 

    Here is a link to our github project https://github.com/users/JRIV-10/projects/2

3. 2-3 sentence summary describing the different approaches your group discussed for project organization and how you collectively made a decision on which to use. 
    
    We discussed on which tools to use to track our progress and ended up deciding on github project. Our initial attempt was to use google sheets to break down and layout our classes with methods but found projects to be easier to use and a better tracking tool. 

4. 2-3 sentence summary describing your approach to the code design.
    
    Our approach for the desgin is creating a file called stat_tracker. After that we create 3 major classes with Game, League, and Season. We will write the methods for each respective class and merge code that is needed into stat_tracker. 

5. Include link to your initial DTR document and the date it was completed. If you do additional DTRs later in the project, you should link the revised versions here as well with the date. New versions should be listed alongside older versions. Do not delete old DTRs.
